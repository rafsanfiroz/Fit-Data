# Computing required data

'''
Before plotting the graphs, process the data you read into the data you need to plot the visualizations. To calculate the performance statistics of individual users, you need to first obtain a list containing daily steps instead of hourly steps because that is your clientâ€™s requirement.

In the main() function, utilize the hourly_to_daily() function and make a dictionary that contains the names as keys and the daily step lists as values.
