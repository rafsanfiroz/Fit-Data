# Visualizing data

'''
With data all stored in appropriate data structures, start working on requirement 4, which is the main gist of this project.

Line plot for a dayâ€™s activity
For this requirement, pick a 24-value portion for any user and plot it using the matplotlib library. Start with the line plot for a particular user on a particular day.
