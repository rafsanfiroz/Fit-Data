# Sorting data

'''
Sorting data is required to plot the bar chart that compares the performance of users. For this part, make a my_sort() named function that takes in a couple of lists, one containing the step counts and the other containing user names, and returns sorted versions of those lists. Furthermore, to sort the two lists, it might be a good choice to make a find_min_index() named helper function that provides the index for the minimum valueâ€™s location in the provided steps list.
